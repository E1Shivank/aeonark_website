# ✅ BLANK SCREEN ISSUE FIXED

## Problem
The app deployed successfully but showed a blank screen because:
- Frontend built with `base: "/Aeonark/"` in vite.config.ts
- Assets were referenced as `/Aeonark/assets/...` in the HTML
- Production server only served static files from root path
- Static assets couldn't be found, causing blank screen

## Solution
Updated `server/index-production.ts` to serve static files from both paths:
```typescript
// Serve static files from both root and /Aeonark/ paths
app.use(express.static(distPath));
app.use("/Aeonark", express.static(distPath));
```

## Test Results
✅ HTML page: HTTP 200 OK
✅ JavaScript assets: HTTP 200 OK  
✅ CSS assets: HTTP 200 OK
✅ Production server working correctly

## Ready for Render.com
Your Dockerfile is now complete and will show the working Aeonark Labs website:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed blank screen - static assets now served correctly"
git push origin main
```

The website will load properly on Render.com!
